This is my attempt to clone a DF3 but with changes I think are useful. In all my putters, personalization and customization are core design principles.
The biggest change is the addition of a face insert. The insert is mechanically attached, unlike the insert on the OZ1i which is glued on. There's nothing inherently wrong with gluing on inserts, almost all putters on the market with inserts use a glued attachment; my background as an engineer has always taught me to never make something permananet that doesn't need to be.
The second notable change is that the "body" of the putter and the piece that holds the face insert are two different parts. They are use 3/32" dowel pins to make a locating attachment in the z axis, and M3 flat head screws behind the face insert to make the secure mechanical attachment.
